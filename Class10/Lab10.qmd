## What's in the PDB Database?

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB <www.rcsb.org>.

This database contains:
```{r}
pdb_csv <- read.csv("Class10.csv", row.names = 1)
pdb_csv
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

First need to get rid of the commas - can you find a function to get rid of the commas?

```{r}
x <- pdb_csv$X.ray
as.numeric(sub(",","",x))
```

Let's write a function for this and then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data. 
```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(sub(",","",x)))
}
apply(pdb_csv, 2, sumcomma)

(apply(pdb_csv, 2, sumcomma))/sumcomma(pdb_csv$Total) *100
```

84.5% of structures are solved by X-ray and 8.7% are solved by electron microscopy. 


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdb_total <- sumcomma(pdb_csv$Total)
(as.numeric(sub(",","",pdb_csv[1, "Total"])))/pdb_total

```

0.86 of the structures in the PDB are protein. 

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?


There are about `r 186898/2488057533 * 100` structures in the PDB. 

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

Here, I insert my image with the Asp in both Chain A and B as spacefill into the program.

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility/dynamics):

```{r}
pdb_1 <- read.pdb("6s36")

# Normal mode analysis = NMA
m <- nma(pdb_1)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
# Writes a pdb file to working directory
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structures

Now we will work through a complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of structure, dynamics, and function. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

id <- "1ake_A" # adenylate kinase
aa <- get.seq(id)

aa
```
```{r}
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)

hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
# Paths argument will put the downloads in a new folder
```

Now we will align them super slay
```{r}
# Align releated PDBs

pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Print out the alignment:
```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
